# TypeAhead

This task is from the challenge "30 projects in 30 days", in which I made `TypeAhead` by vanilla JS. 
In this assignment, I improved my knowledge of http and ajax.You can use it for your own purposes.


### Quickstart
You can see the working UI/UX of this task by the link: https://khanevich.github.io/TypeAhead/

### Create a new project based on the TypeAhead

Clone this repo into new project folder (e.g., TypeAhead).

git clone https://github.com/khanevich/TypeAhead TypeAhead

cd TypeAhead
